#+TITLE: Env parsing state machine
This was my first attempt at implementing state machine functionality to parse .env files. This is typically something highly needed in high level languages, C already has a built-in API for interracting with environment variables but only those that are inherited from the parent, not ones you can load from an .env file.

* Requirements
- one build tool that I use constantly is [[https://command-not-found.com/cmake][cmake]]. Make sure that you have an up to date version, even though I do not use cmake to its full capabilities.

* Building
A build directory is required to dump all the build artifacts into. My personal preference to name the directory as =bin=.

#+begin_src bash
  mkdir <build_directory>
  cd <build_directory>
  cmake ..
  make
#+end_src
